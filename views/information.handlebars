        <h3>Learn more about DEPRESSION</h3>
<br>
        It's often said that depression results from a chemical imbalance, but that figure of speech doesn't capture how
        complex the disease is.<br> Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having too much or too
        little of certain brain chemicals.<br>
        Rather, there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic
        vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. It's believed that several of these
        forces interact to bring on depression.
