            <h2>WHAT IS BIPOLAR DISORDER?</h2>

            <p>
                Bipolar disorder is a mental illness marked by extreme shifts in mood.
                Symptoms can include an extremely elevated mood called mania. They can also include episodes of
                depression.
                Bipolar disorder is also known as bipolar disease or manic depression.
                People with bipolar disorder may have trouble managing everyday life tasks at school or work, or
                maintaining
                relationships.
                There’s no cure, but there are many treatment options available that can help to manage the symptoms.

            <p>
                It's often said that depression results from a chemical imbalance, but that figure of speech doesn't
                capture how complex the disease is. Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having
                too much or
                too little of certain brain chemicals.
                Rather, there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood regulation by the brain,
                genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. It's believed that
                several of
                these forces interact to bring on depression.

            <h2>WHAT IS SCHIZOPHRENIA?</h2>

            <p>
                Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally.
                Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered
                thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.
                People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms under
                control
                before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.
            </p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>

            <ul>
                <strong>
                    <li style="list-style-type: none;">Delusions</li>
                </strong>
                <li>These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being
                    harmed or
                    harassed.</li>
                <strong>
                    <li>Hallucinations</li>
                </strong>
                <li>These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with
                    schizophrenia,
                    they have the full force and impact of a normal experience.</li>
                <strong>
                    <li>Disorganized thinking</li>
                </strong>
                <li>Rarely speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes
                    known as
                    word salad.</li>
            </ul>
