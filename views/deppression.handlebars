        <h2>DEPPRESSION</h2>
        It's often said that depression results from a chemical imbalance, but that figure of speech doesn't capture how
        complex the disease is.<br> Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having too much or too
        little of certain brain chemicals.<br>
        Rather, there are many possible causes of depression, including faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic
        vulnerability,<br> stressful life events, medications, and medical problems. It's believed that several of these
        forces interact to bring on depression.
